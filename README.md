# job-search-engine
A web app for finding tech jobs and gauging employer demands

## Description
The Job Search Engine is a web app that performs two main features: It presents users with the most in-demand skills and requirements from employers in their area, and it shows users the jobs in their area that they are most compatible with based on their skills and experience. Additionally, users can create accounts and view their dashboard to see at a glance how in-demand their skills are and what jobs they should apply for. Job data is scraped from the web and visualized using bar charts and choropleth maps (geographical heat maps). The app focuses specifically on jobs in the computer science field. The goal of the Job Search Engine is to make it easier for those in computer science and related fields to strengthen their resume and/or find employment in their area.

## Tech Stack
The Job Search Engine utilizes a PostgreSQL database, Django back-end, React front-end, and Node.js runtime environment. Additional libraries will be used, including the JobSpy Python library for scraping job data from the web, the Chart.js JavaScript library for displaying graphs, and the Leaflet JavaScript library for displaying choropleth maps.
